# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohammad

I'm a Platform and Software Engineer living in the Netherlands. I like to make complex systems simple and reliable. I mostly work with **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, **NixOS**, and backend development in **Go**.

I created [**Rivaas**](https://github.com/rivaas-dev/rivaas), a web framework for Go. It helps developers build cloud services with fast routing, clear request handling, OpenAPI support, and built-in metrics and tracing.

I also built [**Wait4X**](https://github.com/wait4x/wait4x). It is a small tool that waits for services in scripts and CI/CD pipelines. You can think of it as a smarter `sleep` 😄.

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile! 👋
