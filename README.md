# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Mohammad

I'm a Platform & Software Engineer from the Netherlands who loves turning complex infrastructure into simple, reliable tools. I work with **Kubernetes**, **Terraform**, **NixOS**, and write backend stuff in Go.

I also built [**Wait4X**](https://github.com/wait4x/wait4x) â€” a tiny but powerful tool that waits for services in your scripts and CI/CD pipelines. It's like `sleep`, but smarter ðŸ˜Ž.

Thanks for dropping by! ðŸ‘‹
