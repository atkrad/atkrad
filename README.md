In this difficult time, our hearts are with the people of Iran ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡·. We know that many are going through fear, pain, and uncertainty. No one should have to face violence or live in fear of attacks. We believe in peace, in the power of unity, and in standing together when it matters most. Even from far away, we want to say: you are not alone. We hope for safety, strength, and a better tomorrow for everyone affected.
